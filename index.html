                My name is Andrew Richardson. I currently work for an investment firm, but am looking to make a career change that can make me more versatile and give me a skill I can really use and take pride in. This has lead me to begin learning web development through the UofA coding bootcamp.

                I spend a lot of my free time with my daughter, who is three years old. Her mother is from China, so currently she is being taught how to read both English and Chinese print. She's taking to it very well!
                <br><br>
                In some down time, I enjoy firing up my PlayStation4. When we didn't have to worry about a global pandemic, I also loved to play ice hockey on weekends for a D league team in Scottsdale. Travel has always been a big love of mine, and I have an ever growing list of places I want to visit.
